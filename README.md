## Hi 👋
- 👨‍💻 I'm some sort of a full-stack developer? If [this](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) description makes me a full-stack developer.
- 📖 I work with C++, C, JavaScript, HTML, Lua, PHP, CSS, Java, SQL, C#, Python and probably some other languages I have forgotten.
- 🌱 Learning: Rust, Assembly.
- 🖥️ I love open source anything. FOSS is where it's at. Linux is dope yo!
- 🎮 I love gaming. I mostly play FPS and factorio.
- 🤝 I like to discuss coding, FOSS, and tech. Feel free to talk to me about any of them.
- 📫 If you want to get in contact quickly discord is probably the best place to start @xm4ddy.
